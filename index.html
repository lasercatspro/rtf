      <p>Hey üëã !</p>

      <p>We‚Äôre fed up with the never-ending feed.</p>
      
      <p>We‚Äôre fed up with black-box algorithms.</p>
      
      <p>We want to <em>move from <strong>flux</strong> to <strong>stock</strong></em>.</p>
      
      <p>We want to sort, we want to filter, we want control over our feed.</p>
      
      <hr>
      
      <p>We are here to experiment with new ways to use social media.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What if ?</strong></p>
      
      <p>... we could send and/or receive posts <em>only once a day</em>?</p>
      
      <p>... we knew <em>how many posts</em> were in our timeline since the last time we connected?</p>
      
      <p>... we had a <em>gorgeous</em> interface to read the hottest articles from our communities?</p>
      
      <p>... the people we follow had a <em>dedicated place</em> in our feed?</p>
      
      <p>... we could focus on only the most <em>important posts</em> from our feed?</p>

      <hr>

      <p>We‚Äôre going to try this, and more.</p>
      
      <p>Do you want to join us?</p>
