      <p>We‚Äôre fed up with the never-ending feed.</p>
      
      <p>We‚Äôre fed up with black-box algorithms.</p>
      
      <p>We want to <em>move from flux to stock.</em></p>
      
      <p>We want to sort, we want to filter, we want control over our feed.</p>
      
      <p>We just want to know what our friends are talking about.</p>
      
      <p>We just want to know what‚Äôs trending in our communities.</p>
      
      <p>We don‚Äôt want to miss the important things.</p>
      
      <p>And we want to have a good time.</p>
      
      <p>And maybe, we‚Äôll even spend less time on computers.</p>
      
      <p>We are here to experiment with new ways to use social media.</p>
      
      <p>What if we could send and/or receive posts <em>once a day</em>?</p>
      
      <p>What if we knew how many posts were in our timeline since the last time we connected?</p>
      
      <p>What if we had a gorgeous interface to read the hottest articles from our communities?</p>
      
      <p>What if the people we follow had a dedicated place in our home feed?</p>
      
      <p>What if we could focus on only the most important posts from our feed?</p>
      
      <p>We‚Äôre going to try this, and more.</p>
